/**
 * This package is the root package of (most) of
 * {@link branch.alixia.unnamed.Unnamed}'s internal/private code. Feel free to
 * like, explore this and stuff.<br>
 * <br>
 * All public APIs are stored in other packages in
 * <code>branch.alixia.unnamed</code>. Everything inside
 * <code>branch.alixia.kröw</code> is private.<br>
 * <br>
 * This program isn't an API, it's a program, so I can't really determine how to
 * style the packaging off of the Java Library's source code like I can with
 * variable names or other convention related things. I just kinda shoved all
 * private things into the <code>kröw</code> package.
